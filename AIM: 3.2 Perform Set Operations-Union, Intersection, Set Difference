AIM: 3.2 Perform Set Operations-Union, Intersection, Set Difference 

Description:

Set Operators

1) UNION is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements. It will -eliminate 

duplicate rows from its resultset.

Syntax:-

SELECT column_name FROM table1 

UNION

SELECT column_name FROM table2;

2) UNION ALL This is similar to Union. But it also shows the duplicate rows. 

Syntax:-

SELECT column_name FROM table1

UNION ALL

SELECT column_name FROM table2;

3) Intersect operation is used to combine two SELECT statements, but it only retuns the records 

which are common from both SELECT statements.

Syntax:-

SELECT column_name FROM table1 

INTERSECT

SELECT column_name FROM table2;

4) The Minus operation combines results of two SELECT statements and return only those in the 

final result, which belongs to the first set of the result.

Syntax:-

SELECT column_name FROM table1 

MINUS

SELECT column_name FROM table2;
