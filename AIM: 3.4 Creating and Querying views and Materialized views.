Description:

View

A view is a logical table based on the result set of an SQL Statement. A view contains rows and 

columns, just like a table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more base tables in the 

database. We can apply all DDL and DML statements on views.

Syntax:

Create or replace force/noforce view viewname as 

Select column_list from table_list
