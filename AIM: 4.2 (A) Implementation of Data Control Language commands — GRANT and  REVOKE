Description:

DCL commands control access to data in the database.

• GRANT: Allows users to access and manipulate database objects.

• REVOKE: Removes previously granted privileges.

Syntax:

GRANT privilege_name ON object_name TO user_name;

REVOKE privilege_name ON object_name FROM user_name;

Example:

CREATE TABLE student_login (

 userid VARCHAR2(10),

 password VARCHAR2(20)

);

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON student_login TO user1;

REVOKE INSERT ON student_login FROM user1;

Explanation:

• The GRANT statement gives user1 permission to select and insert records into the table.

• The REVOKE statement removes the insert permission from user1.

AIM: 4.2 (B) Implementation of Transaction Control Language commands —

COMMIT, SAVEPOINT, and ROLLBACK

Description:

TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database.

• COMMIT: Saves all the changes made in the current transaction.

• ROLLBACK: Undoes the changes of the current transaction.

• SAVEPOINT: Creates a temporary point in a transaction for partial rollback.

Syntax:

COMMIT;

ROLLBACK;

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;

Example:

CREATE TABLE accounts (

 accno NUMBER,

 name VARCHAR2(20),

 balance NUMBER

);

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (101, 'Ravi', 2000);

SAVEPOINT A;

INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (102, 'Suma', 3000);

SAVEPOINT B;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE accno = 101;

ROLLBACK TO B;

COMMIT;

ACCNO NAME BALANCE

101 Ravi 2000

102 Suma 3000

Explanation:

1. SAVEPOINT A and SAVEPOINT B mark transaction stages.

2. ROLLBACK TO B cancels the update done after B but retains all changes before it.

3. COMMIT makes the remaining changes permanent.
