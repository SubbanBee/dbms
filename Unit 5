AIM: 5.1 Create a Primary and Secondary Index on a Column

Description:

An index improves the speed of data retrieval operations in a database.

There are two main types:

• Primary Index – created automatically when a primary key is defined.

• Secondary Index – created manually on non-primary key columns to improve search performance.

Indexes work like book indexes — instead of scanning all pages (rows), the database can jump directly to 

the desired data.

Syntax:

-- Primary Index (Automatically created using PRIMARY KEY)

CREATE TABLE table_name (

 column1 datatype PRIMARY KEY,

 column2 datatype,

 ...

);

-- Secondary Index (Manually created)

CREATE INDEX index_name

ON table_name (column_name);

Example:

CREATE TABLE Students (

 StudentID VARCHAR2(10) PRIMARY KEY,

 StudentName VARCHAR2(30),

 Major VARCHAR2(20)

);

-- Creating Secondary Index on StudentName

CREATE INDEX idx_studentname

ON Students (StudentName);

Output:

Table created.

Index created.




AIM: 5.2 Retrieve Data Using an Index

Description:

When a query uses an indexed column in the WHERE clause, the database engine uses the index to quickly 

locate the matching rows, improving performance.

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students WHERE StudentName = 'Kiran';

Since the StudentName column has a secondary index (idx_studentname), this query will retrieve the record faster 

than a full table scan.

AIM: 5.3 Insert Data and Update Indexes

Description:

When new records are inserted, the indexes are automatically updated by the database.

This ensures that all future retrievals remain efficient.

Example:

INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('S02', 'Ravi', 'ECE');

INSERT INTO Students VALUES ('S03', 'Bala', 'EEE');

The database automatically updates:

• The Primary Index for StudentID

• The Secondary Index for StudentName

To Verify:

SELECT * FROM Students;

STUDENTID STUDENT

NAME

MAJOR

S01 Kiran CSE

S02 Ravi ECE

S03 Bala EEE


AIM: 5.4 Delete Data and Observe Impact on Indexes

Description:

When a row is deleted, the corresponding entries in all indexes are also automatically removed by the 

database.

This maintains data consistency and prevents invalid index references.

Example:

DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 'S02';

The index entries for 'S02' and 'Ravi' are automatically deleted from the primary and secondary indexes.

To Verify:

SELECT * FROM Students;

STUDENTID STUDENT

NAME

MAJOR

S01 Kiran CSE

S03 Bala ECE

Conclusion:

• Primary indexes are automatically created and maintained by the DBMS.

• Secondary indexes are created manually for faster access on non-key columns.

• Both indexes automatically update when data is inserted, deleted, or modified.
